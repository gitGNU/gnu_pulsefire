TODO LIST:
- When using 16 pwm outputs last output step had extratime.
- Added SF_ENABLE_EXT_MEGA to test it
- Added HHO MMW code to auto lpm
- Added more commands/tests to MAL
- invert per output
- A step cycle of over 100%, so we have phasing, the LEDs will overlap each other?
- Operation manual
- Port to arm7
- Port to arm9 aka PandaBoard
